# Digital Vulnerability Management Platform (DVMP)
## Platform Documentation for SRE Team

**Overview**
Digital Vunerability Management is a single pane of glass for all vulnerability data. It is built on CodeDX to centralize and manage vulnerabilities across the software development lifecycle into one place. It is integrated with GitHub and multiple security tools (SAST, DAST, SCA, Secrets Detection-Trufflehog, penetration testing, and code-signing).
Security Engineers triage vulnerabilities following the Risk remediation process.
