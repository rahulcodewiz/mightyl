# AI Illustration Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you fix common issues when creating AI-generated illustrations. When your images don't match your vision, use these systematic approaches to refine your prompts.

## Common Problems & Solutions

### 1. Character Inconsistency Issues

**Problem**: Character looks different in each illustration
**Solution**: Create a detailed character reference prompt

>**Character Reference Template:**
>- **Breed/Species**: [Specific type]
>- **Color**: [Exact colors with shading details]
>- **Eyes**: [Size, color, expression style]
>- **Face**: [Shape, features, expressions]
>- **Posture**: [Typical stance, body language]
>- **Size**: [Proportions, build]
>- **Style**: [Consistent art style reference]

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ Vague: "A cow in the forest"
✅ Specific: "Pixar-style 3D white Indian cow with soulful brown eyes, graceful posture, slender build"
```

### 2. Style Inconsistency

**Problem**: Art style varies between illustrations
**Solution**: Use consistent style descriptors

>**Style Reference:**
>- **Primary Style**: "Pixar-style 3D"
>- **Rendering**: "Semi-realistic, soft lighting"
>- **Color Palette**: "Warm, natural tones"
>- **Texture**: "Smooth, polished surfaces"

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ Inconsistent: "3D cow" vs "cartoon cow"
✅ Consistent: "Pixar-style 3D semi-realistic cow"
```

### 3. Expression Problems

**Problem**: Character emotions don't match the story
**Solution**: Be specific about facial expressions

>**Expression Guide:**
>- **Sad**: "Head lowered, downcast eyes, drooping features"
>- **Happy**: "Bright eyes, upturned mouth, perky ears"
>- **Worried**: "Furrowed brow, tense posture, alert eyes"
>- **Calm**: "Gentle expression, relaxed features, peaceful eyes"

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ Vague: "The cow looks sad"
✅ Specific: "Cow with teary eyes, head bowed, gentle expression"
```

### 4. Lighting Issues

**Problem**: Lighting doesn't create the right mood
**Solution**: Specify lighting details

>**Lighting Descriptors:**
>- **Time of Day**: "Twilight", "Golden hour", "Midday sun"
>- **Direction**: "Light filtering through trees", "Backlit", "Side lighting"
>- **Quality**: "Soft", "Harsh", "Diffused", "Dramatic"
>- **Color**: "Warm golden light", "Cool blue shadows"

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ Basic: "Forest scene"
✅ Detailed: "Forest path at twilight with soft golden light filtering through tall trees"
```

### 5. Composition Problems

**Problem**: Scene layout doesn't work
**Solution**: Specify camera angle and composition

>**Composition Elements:**
>- **Camera Angle**: "Eye level", "Low angle", "Bird's eye view"
>- **Framing**: "Close-up", "Medium shot", "Wide shot"
>- **Focus**: "Character in foreground", "Background blur"
>- **Rule of Thirds**: "Character positioned off-center"

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ Basic: "Cow walking"
✅ Specific: "Medium shot of cow walking on forest path, character positioned left of center"
```

## Systematic Troubleshooting Process

### Step 1: Identify the Problem
- What specifically is wrong with the image?
- Which element needs fixing?

### Step 2: Choose the Right Fix
- **Character**: Refine character description
- **Style**: Adjust style descriptors
- **Expression**: Modify emotional cues
- **Lighting**: Change lighting details
- **Composition**: Adjust camera/positioning

### Step 3: Test the Fix
- Generate 2-3 variations
- Compare results
- Choose the best version

### Step 4: Document Success
- Save the working prompt
- Note what fixed the issue
- Add to your prompt library

## Quick Fix Reference

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Character looks different | Add specific breed/color details |
| Style inconsistent | Use same style descriptor every time |
| Wrong expression | Specify exact facial features |
| Bad lighting | Add time of day and light quality |
| Poor composition | Specify camera angle and framing |

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### When Multiple Issues Occur
1. Fix one problem at a time
2. Start with the most obvious issue
3. Test each fix before moving to the next
4. Keep a log of what works

### Prompt Refinement Strategy
```
Original Prompt → Identify Problem → Apply Fix → Test → Refine → Final Result
```

## Example Troubleshooting Session

**Initial Prompt**: "Cow in forest"
**Problem**: Generic, inconsistent character

**Fix 1**: "Pixar-style 3D white Indian cow in forest"

**Problem**: Missing emotional context

**Final Fix**: "Pixar-style 3D white Indian cow with soulful brown eyes, head lowered, walking sadly on forest path at twilight"

**Result**: ✅ Perfect match for the story

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Patient**: Good prompts take iteration
2. **Document Everything**: Keep a prompt library
3. **Test Incrementally**: Change one thing at a time
4. **Use References**: Save images that work well
5. **Learn Patterns**: Notice what consistently works
